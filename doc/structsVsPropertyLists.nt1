Run structtest?.lisp.  The struct versions are about 17, 50, 100 times
faster than the property list versions!

*That* is the thing to work on to speed up popco.  (It's a big job,
though.)

(Hmm. I wonder whether you can make structs even faster in some
situations by typing the slots.  But they are pretty fast as it is.)
