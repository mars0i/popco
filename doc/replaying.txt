To replay a run from the start:

Suppose you ran popco like this:
	popco mymodelscript.lisp
and it generated, as one of its output files
	../data/RUN123456789.lisp
This file contains Lisp code to reset the random state (seed)
to what it was on run that generated it.  So to replay the run:
	popco ../data/RUN123456789.lisp mymodelscript.lisp
That's it.

However, if you're not using the popco script, and running
popco directly with sbcl, then the trick is that the
RUNblahblah.lisp has to be loaded *after* start.lisp
but before other scripts that might start using the randomness.
