If you run seqtests.lisp, you'll see that for simple mapping over
two sequences, mapc is faster than mapcar, map nil with declared
lists is like mapc, and map nil with declared vectors is
significantly slower than mapc. (!)

(I wonder if that is related to the style warning about nreverse.
Apparently map list reverses an intermediate list.  Maybe with
vectors the same sort of thing happens.)
