which calls set-assoc-weight
which calls calc-assoc-weight 
and set-symlink-weight in network.lisp

set-symlink-weight does no summing or modification of the weight
the calculation of the weight is done by calc-assoc-weight.
the map node's activation is passed in to this in parameter degree
and currently 11/2012, when normalize-degree is a noop,
calc-assoc-weight just scales by multiplying the activation
if positive, by *propn-excit-weight* = .2
if negative, by *propn-inhib-weight* = .025 i.e. 1/8 of the excit weight
Note that since abs value of activation can't exceed 1, the resulting
abs val link weight will also be < 1, in fact < .2.
