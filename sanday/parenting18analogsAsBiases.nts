parenting18analogsAsBiases.nts

What the files do:
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1.lisp	main code for experiments
The rest of these load the preceding file, specify parameters, and run the population:
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1a.lisp	sky bias,   N=10,  *max-pop-ticks* = 100
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1b.lisp	sky bias,   N=100, *max-pop-ticks* = 100
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1c.lisp	earth bias, N=10,  *max-pop-ticks* = 500
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1d.lisp	earth bias, N=100, *max-pop-ticks* = 2000
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1e.lisp	earth bias, N=100, *max-pop-ticks* = 1500
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1f.lisp	earth bias, N=10,  *max-pop-ticks* = 1500
	parenting18analogsAsBiases1g.lisp	earth bias, N=10,  *max-pop-ticks* = 100

running parenting18analogsAsBiases1a.lisp (which uses
parenting18analogsAsBiases1.lisp) repeatedly for 2000 ticks is producing
different results randomly, although perhaps there are some limited
commonalities.  What I want to happen is that the hunting propns go high
in the non-perceiving persons, and the parenting go low, but in fact
mostly they both go high, except that at least partially randomly there
are a few low.  i.e. which ones are low changes from time to time.  Also
you get some slightly low sky propns, but again that is random, it
seems.  However in three runs, in each case I think that
p-protochild-inside was among the low propns.  So maybe that's
guaranteed (which would be kind of interesting but maybe not worth
investigating).

I do sometimes get a higher hunting average than parenting average,
even if the variances are extremely high--i.e. I'm getting split
high/low propns in both domains.

Changing from popsize of 10 to 100 does not produce the desired
result, at least in one run with 1000 ticks.

NOTE: Look at the agents in NetLogo.  Several of the lifestyle propns
have *no* links to them.  This is more obvious initially before you
start the run.  (I don't believe that new propn links are created that
would be visible in NetLogo.)  Surprisingly, this is so for hunting as
well as parenting propns.  So some propns are simply unaffected by the
sky analog.  (Is this right?)


DOING IT WITH EARTH ORIGIN AS THE BG ANALOG RATHER THAN SKY ORIGIN WORKS
A LITTLE BETTER.  Quite well, it seems.  With N=10 I can get average
parenting values to get near 1, while average hunting stays pretty near
zero, stabilizing between 1000 and 1500 (run
parenting18analogsAsBiases1c48361).  There are still some beliefs that
are going negative among the earth origins.  Don't know whether there's
systamaticity to them.

And the SECOND TIME I ran this it was even better (interestingly!).
Parenting pegged at the perceptual value (near 1) with no variance, and
hunting pegged at an average of zero (with SD near 1), despite one
member of the 10-person pop continuing to perceive hunting propns.  This
is great.
BUT I'm going to have to do lots of runs.
THIRD RUN also pegged parenting; pegged hunting a little above zero.
Note there is interesting variation in fluctuations of hunting
averages before they stabilize together.  I suspect that different
propns are going high or low on each run.  Note that there *are* a lot
of hunting propns going high, but others are going low, so the average
is middling.

And note that although I'm not getting the same effect with sky origin;
there is a big *difference* between running with the different origin
backgrounds.

Interestingly, it feels as if using sky origin as the bg is a lot
slower.  Haven't timed it though.

NEED TO DO MORE RUNS

things to try:

see if the same kind of thing happens going the other way, i.e.
making earth but not sky propns available.

lower the degree of belief of perception.

change relative strength of perception and analogy in some other ways,
e.g. by lowering the amount of confidence that hearing an utterance
gives.  

Or e.g. add decay to memory--i.e. decay the connections to SALIENT, at
least for the connections produced by utterances.
