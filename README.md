### Abstract

#### Purpose

Agent-based models are typically “simple-agent” models, in which agents
behave according to simple rules, or “complex-agent” models which
incorporate complex models of cognitive processes. I argue that there is
also an important role for agent-based computer models in which agents
incorporate cognitive models of moderate complexity. In particular, I
argue that such models have the potential to bring insights from the
humanistic study of culture into population-level modeling of cultural
change.

#### Methods

I motivate my proposal in part by describing an agent-based modeling
framework, POPCO, in which agents’ communication of their simulated
beliefs depends on a model of analogy processing implemented by
artificial neural networks within each agent. I use POPCO to model a
hypothesis about causal relations between cultural patterns proposed by
Peggy Sanday.

#### Results

In model 1, empirical patterns like those reported by Sanday emerge from
the influence of analogies on agents’ communication with each other.
Model 2 extends model 1 by allowing the components of a new analogy to
diffuse through the population for reasons unrelated to later effects of
the analogy. This illustrates a process by which novel cultural features
might arise.

#### Conclusions

The inclusion of relatively simple cognitive models in agents allows
modeling population-level effects of inferential and cultural coherence
relations, including symbolic cultural relationships. I argue that such
models of moderate complexity can illuminate various causal
relationships involving cultural patterns and cognitive processes.
