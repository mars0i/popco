What is this branch?
=======

This was forked from master on 5/10/2014.  It differs from master in
that all numbers have been changed to integers or ratios, rather than
long floats, and type declarations have been removed or commented out.
Things like max and min activation have been changed from .99, -.99, to
1, -1.  All of this is for the purpose of experiments comparing popco1
(this popco) with popco2 (nee popco-x, i.e. the Clojure rewrite.)
Note: *very* slow.
