RECENT:

myplot.R was renamed to plotDFs.R .
It contains functions that popco averages, stddevs, and just raw
activations, directly from dataframes.  (I wrote this stuff when I was
just learning R.)

popcoPlot.R was renamed to plotDFsWithMetaCols.R
This is a revision of myplot.R that I made when I had added two extra
columns (pop-ticks, run-id) to my csv file output.  It's pretty much
the same as plotDFs.R but works around the existence of the extra
columns.  Subsequently I got rid of the extra columns, but something
similar might come back some day.


OLD NOTES:
myplot.R contains functions appropriate until 9/24,
when I added pop-ticks and run-id columns to the csv file.
popcoPlot.R contains the successor routines for use after that.
However, I subsequently got rid of those columns.  So
myplot.R is probably the one needed.
