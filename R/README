RECENT:

plotDFs.R:
Formerly myplot.R
It contains functions that popco averages, stddevs, and just raw
activations, directly from dataframes.  (I wrote this stuff when I was
just learning R.)

plotDFsWithMetaCols.R:
Formerly popcoPlot.R
This is a revision of myplot.R that I made when I had added two extra
columns (pop-ticks, run-id) to my csv file output.  It's pretty much
the same as plotDFs.R but works around the existence of the extra
columns.  Subsequently I got rid of the extra columns, but something
similar might come back some day.

csvs2vec.sh:
Shell script: Given a series of filenames on a single line in stdin,
e.g. produced via
	echo *.csv | csvs2vec.sh
this script constructs the R command
	csvs <- c("filename1","filename2",...,"filenameN")
which can then be pasted into R.

df2ra.R:
Routines for loading csv files, converting to dataframes,
converting the dataframes to 3-D arrays, converting a series
of 3-D arrays to a 4-D array, extracting subarrays.  
See file for details.

df2raWithMetaCols.R:
Old version of df2ra.R from the period in which pop-tick and run-id
were extra columsn in the csv files.  Doesn't contain everything in
the more recent versions.  Most of this code is still
in df2ra.R, but commented out, as of 10/1/2012.

..............................................
OLD NOTES:
myplot.R contains functions appropriate until 9/24,
when I added pop-ticks and run-id columns to the csv file.
popcoPlot.R contains the successor routines for use after that.
However, I subsequently got rid of those columns.  So
myplot.R is probably the one needed.
