In R, see "Writing R Extensions" in Help.
There's also a "tutorial" at http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Leisch-CreatingPackages.pdf, but you have to wade through lots of irrelevant stuff
to get to the important stuff at the end, which isn't very clearly
presented anyway.

Well actually that PDF is useful.  Go to section 5.2.  That might
be all you need.  i.e. do something like this:

mv old package dir so that R can make a new one.

I thought this would work, but seems not:
package.skeleton(name="popco", code_files=c("df2ra.R","popcoplots.R","popcotests.R","utils.R"))

Better:
source all the R files you want included, then just do:
	package.skeleton(name="popco")

Now copy doc files etc that you had hacked earlier from the old
package dir to the new one:

	cp olddir/DESCRIPTION newdir
	olddir/man/* newdir/man

Then from the command line, do e.g. from the dir that contains the
newly created package dir:

	R CMD INSTALL -l `pwd` popco

This is in section 6 of the "tutorial".

Then fix any problems.
