Description: POPCO is a framework, written mainly in Common Lisp, for constructing agent-based simulations in which agents communicate beliefs, and each agent's degrees of beliefs are influenced by what other beliefs they have, and what those beliefs degrees of beliefs are.  This package collects R functions written to aid in the analysis of data generated by POPCO.
