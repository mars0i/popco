;; NOTES ON RUNS
; In ecl:
; For the ISOMORPHIC, NONPRAGMATIC version:
; I'm getting almost exact replication of results reported
; in H&T 1989, p. 346, table 20, except for these differences:
; For obj-idea=obj-child I get around .92 rather than .90
; For obj-student=obj-mother I get .99 (max possible) rather than .69
; There are couple of others that are 1/100 off.
; However, all of the best maps are as H&T say, and the result is
; very clean, in that in each case the alternatives are substantially
; negative.  The proposition maps also come out very cleanly.
