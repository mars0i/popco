qsub
qdel
qsub -N yaya  gives your job an informative name 'yaya'
qsub -hold_jid 9035365     makes it wait until job 9035365 completes successfully
there's also 
	qsub -hold_jid_ad ...  
I think, which allows waiting until an "array of jobs" --i.e. what you start with e.g. -t 1-100 -- is finished.
But I don't know the syntax yet.

qstat
qstat -ext
qstat -r
qstat -r -ext
qstat -f  lists all processors and what's running in them, including your jobs

example:
qsub -hold_jid 9035365 -N pt2v2df /home/mabrams/jobs/submitanything.job /home/mabrams/jobs/findDisagreementAndMakeDataframesCrime3socnet5.sh socnet5pt2with150runsV2 5000
