Please try to construct jobs (or tasks for array jobs) that will finish
in hours, rather than days or weeks.

The default max runtime for jobs is 15 minutes. To override, request
the an appropriate max runtime using the 'h_rt' resource request. 

Also make sure to specify how much memory will be needed for each job
slot. For example, to request 4 hours of run time and 2 GB per slot
(use M for megabytes, and G for gigabytes) add this to your job script

#$ -l h_rt=04:00:00,vf=2G
