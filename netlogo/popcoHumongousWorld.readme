popcoHumongousWorld.nlogo uses a very large "world" i.e. the box the
agents appear in.  You'll probably need to increase the Java heap size
to do this.  e.g. I found the default 1024M to be too small, but 1536M
large enough.  See
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/faq.html#howbig for
instructions for changing the heap size in different OSes.
